Traffic Light Digital Circuit

Description:
The goal of the project was to create a circuit simulating a stop light and crosswalk counter. Our state diagram reflects the red LED staying red until the button is pressed. Once pressed, only the green LED is powered for 5 clock cycles (5 seconds), and the 3 other LEDs light up to represent counting down from 5 in binary. Then the yellow LED is displayed for one second and finally goes back to red until the button is pressed and it cycles through again. This replicates a traffic light using flip flops, a clock cycle, AND gates, OR gates, a XOR gate, a button, and LEDs.

Video Description:
The video is a simulation of the traffic light project. The LEDs on the left display a countdown from 5 to 0 in binary (like a crosswalk counter). The LEDs on the far right resemble a traffic light, red until button is pressed, green while counting down, yellow when countdown is on 0, and back to red until button is pressed again.

This project was the final project for CENG 330 at Chapman University.
